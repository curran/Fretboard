Fretboard is a Jack midi client which maps keystrokes to midi notes as though the keyboard were a fretted instrument such as a guitar or bass.

Features:
- Fretboard is a Jack client which outputs midi notes.
- Pressing a key on the keyboard causes the the corresponding fret in the GUI to display a circle, and the corresponding midi note is emitted.
- Preset instrument mappings include guitar, bass, cello, and violin.
- Custom mappings are supported - you can change to the base (lowest open string) midi note (60 is middle C) and the offsets (in half-steps) for each string.
- GPL license.

Dependencies: QT 4, Jack

To make and run:
qmake
make
./fretboard

Enjoy!
